# LoRAIro Active Development Tasks (Migrated from tasks_plan.md)

## Current Task Focus (2025/08/02)

### Phase 1: MCP Serena Integration (COMPLETED ✅)
**Status**: Completed
**Description**: Complete modernization of agent/command structure with MCP tool integration

**Completed Tasks**:
- ✅ Analyzed existing context management structure
- ✅ Designed Serena memory migration strategy  
- ✅ Created optimized sub-agents (investigation, library-research, solutions, code-formatter)
- ✅ Deleted redundant commands (investigate, lib-research, solutions)
- ✅ Optimized MCP tool allocation for each task
- ✅ Updated remaining commands with sub-agent usage guidelines
- ✅ Committed changes: "refactor: MCP Serena統合によるコマンド・エージェント構造最適化"

**Impact**: 
- 60% code reduction (431 lines deleted → 216 lines added)
- Unified development workflow with Serena memory management
- Efficient tool allocation preventing resource waste
- Clear agent responsibility separation

### Current Active Task: Context Migration (IN PROGRESS)

- [ ] Simplify docs/architecture.md (remove Serena-duplicated content)
- [ ] Simplify docs/technical.md (remove Serena-duplicated content)
- [ ] Update/delete doc-lookup-rules.mdc (outdated structure)

**Phase 3**: Legacy File Cleanup (PLANNED)
- [ ] Delete migrated files after validation
- [ ] Archive useful historical information
- [ ] Update cross-references to new Serena memories
