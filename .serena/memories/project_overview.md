# LoRAIro Project Overview

## Project Purpose
LoRAIro is an **AI-powered LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) image dataset preparation tool** written in Python. It automates the creation of high-quality image datasets for machine learning training by providing:

- **Image Processing**: Automated resizing, format conversion, cropping
- **AI Annotation**: Multi-provider AI tagging and captioning (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)
- **Database Management**: SQLite-based metadata storage with comprehensive search
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient processing of large image collections
- **GUI Interface**: PySide6-based workflow-oriented interface
- **File Management**: Systematic organization of processed images and annotations

## Target Users
- Machine learning researchers preparing LoRA training datasets
- AI artists managing large image collections
- Data scientists requiring automated image annotation
- Content creators organizing and tagging visual assets

## Key Value Proposition
Transforms manual, time-consuming dataset preparation into an automated, AI-driven workflow that maintains high quality while processing thousands of images efficiently.
