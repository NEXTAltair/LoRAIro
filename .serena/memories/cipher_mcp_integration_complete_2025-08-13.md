# Cipher MCP Integration Complete (2025-08-13)

## 統合完了状況

### Architecture Change
- **Before**: Individual MCP servers (context7, playwright, serena)
- **After**: Cipher aggregator mode - single endpoint accessing all MCP services
- **Configuration**: `.mcp.json` → cipher SSE endpoint `http://192.168.11.23:3000/mcp/sse`

### Performance Characteristics
- **Direct serena operations**: 1-3 seconds (search, memory, basic editing)
- **Cipher aggregator operations**: 10-30 seconds (complex analysis, multi-tool integration)
- **Timeout handling**: 30 seconds max, with fallback to direct operations
- **Known issues**: perplexity-ask timeouts, PostgreSQL connection failures in cipher

### Hybrid Operation Strategy
- **Fast operations**: Use direct serena (mcp__serena__*)
- **Complex analysis**: Use cipher (mcp__cipher__ask_cipher) for serena+context7+perplexity-ask integration
- **Fallback**: Always have direct serena backup for cipher failures

### Updated Tools & Commands
- **All .claude/commands/**: Now include cipher integration sections
- **All .claude/agents/**: investigation, library-research, solutions updated with hybrid strategies
- **CLAUDE.md**: Streamlined from 474→224 lines (53% reduction)

### Configuration Files Updated
- `.mcp.json`: Cipher aggregator mode
- `.cursor/rules/mcp-usage-rules.mdc`: New hybrid operation guidelines
- `.cursor/rules/`: Updated for cipher integration
- `docs/architecture.md` & `docs/technical.md`: Architecture documentation

### Key Operational Changes
1. **Command workflow**: Commands now automatically choose between direct serena vs cipher based on complexity
2. **Agent delegation**: Agents use hybrid strategy for optimal performance
3. **Error handling**: Robust fallback from cipher to direct operations
4. **Development efficiency**: Faster simple operations, more comprehensive complex analysis

### Critical Success Factors
- **Tool selection awareness**: Know when to use direct vs cipher operations
- **Timeout management**: Break complex operations into stages if needed
- **Fallback readiness**: Always have direct serena backup plan
- **Performance monitoring**: Track actual response times vs expected

### Git Commits
- `347bd5d`: docs: update MCP integration for cipher+serena hybrid environment
- `589f07b`: config: complete cipher MCP aggregator integration setup

This represents a fundamental shift from individual MCP tool usage to intelligent hybrid operation selection for optimal development workflow efficiency.
