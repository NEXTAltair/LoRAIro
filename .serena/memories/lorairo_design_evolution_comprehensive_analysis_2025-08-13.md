### **Phase 3: Worker System Redesign (2025 Q3)**

#### **Problem Statement:**
- Complex custom worker system (800+ lines)
- PySide6 standard features underutilized
- Non-intuitive directory structure
- High maintenance overhead

#### **Redesign Strategy:**
**Core Principles:**
- **PySide6 Standard Features:** QRunnable + QThreadPool + QProgressDialog
- **GUI Integration:** Workers moved to `gui/workers/`
- **Simplification:** 800 lines → 200 lines (75% reduction)
- **Maintainability:** New developer understanding time 50% reduction

**New Architecture:**
```
SimpleWorkerBase (30 lines) → PySide6 QRunnable
├── WorkerSignals (Qt signals)
├── ProgressManager (QProgressDialog)
└── Specialized Workers (database, thumbnail, annotation)
```

**Implementation Phases:**
1. **Phase 3.1:** Foundation (SimpleWorkerBase, ProgressManager)
2. **Phase 3.2:** Worker Migration (Database, Thumbnail, Annotation)
3. **Phase 3.3:** Legacy Cleanup (Old system removal)

**Outcomes:**
- ✅ 75% code reduction achieved
- ✅ Standard PySide6 patterns adopted
- ✅ Simplified maintenance model
- ✅ Enhanced testability

### **Phase 4: Protocol-Based Architecture Modernization (2025 Q3)**

#### **Modernization Strategy:**
**Goal:** Transition from direct dependencies to protocol-based abstractions

**Key Components:**
- **ModelRegistryServiceProtocol:** Abstract model management
- **SignalManagerServiceProtocol:** Unified signal handling
- **Service Container:** Dependency injection framework
- **Type Safety:** Comprehensive mypy compliance

**Implementation Sequence:**
1. **Foundation:** Protocol definitions and base interfaces
2. **Service Migration:** ModelSelectionService, SearchFilterService
3. **Widget Integration:** Protocol-based widget implementations
4. **Signal Modernization:** Unified naming and handling patterns

**Architecture Benefits:**
- ✅ Loose coupling between components
- ✅ Enhanced testability through mocking
- ✅ Type safety and IDE support
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns

### **Phase 5: Database-Centric Architecture (C Plan) (2025 Q4)**

#### **Strategic Transition:**
**From:** Mixed data sources (ModelInfo, TypedDict, Mock objects)  
**To:** Single source of truth (Database Models)

#### **Critical Issues Identified:**
- **Mock-Based Architecture:** Mock objects masquerading as real Models
- **Hybrid Data Sources:** ModelInfoManager fallback maintained
- **Dictionary Conversions:** `DB → dict → Mock(Model)` inefficiency
- **Empty Dependency Injection:** None values causing empty UI

#### **C Plan Implementation:**
**Required Changes:**
1. **Remove Mock Conversions:** Delete `_convert_*_to_models()` methods
2. **Direct DB Access:** `DB Repository → Real Model → Widget`
3. **Single Data Source:** Eliminate ModelInfoManager fallback
4. **Proper DI:** Inject actual repository instances

**Target Architecture:**
```
GUI Layer (PySide6 only) → Service Layer (Business Logic) → Repository Layer (Data Access) → Database (SQLite)
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Zero Mock object creation
- ✅ Single database data source
- ✅ Direct Model object flow
- ✅ Type safety preserved

### **Phase 6: Architecture Finalization (2025 Q4)**

#### **Final Integration:**
- **Complete Protocol Adoption:** All services protocol-based
- **Database Centralization:** Single source of truth established
- **Clean Architecture:** Clear layer separation maintained
- **Documentation Alignment:** Architecture docs updated

**Rationale:** Improve maintainability, enable visual design tools  
**Impact:** Faster UI development, cleaner separation of concerns

### **4. Service Layer Pattern**
**Decision:** Extract business logic to dedicated service classes  
**Rationale:** Single responsibility, better testability, reusability
