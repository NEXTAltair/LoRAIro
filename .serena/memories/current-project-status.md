# LoRAIro Current Project Status (Migrated from active_context.md)

## Current Focus (Updated: 2025/08/02 - MCP Serena Integration Complete)

### üéØ Recent Major Achievement: MCP Serena + Context7 Integration ‚úÖ
**Implementation Period**: 2025/08/02

#### üèÜ Key Accomplishments
**1. Complete Agent/Command Structure Modernization**
- Deleted redundant slash commands: `/investigate`, `/lib-research`, `/solutions`
- Created optimized sub-agents: `investigation`, `library-research`, `solutions`, `code-formatter`
- Implemented MCP tool allocation optimization for each task
- Added sub-agent usage guidelines to remaining commands

**2. MCP Tool Integration**
- **Serena Tools**: Semantic code analysis, memory management, symbol-level editing
- **Context7 Tools**: Real-time library documentation retrieval
- **Tool Optimization**: Each agent/command uses minimal required tools only
- **Workflow Enhancement**: Agent-based task delegation for maximum efficiency

**3. Context Management Migration**
- Identified existing comprehensive Serena memories (7 detailed files)
- Designed migration strategy from scattered task files to unified Serena management
- Maintained backward compatibility while modernizing workflow

### Previous Major Development (2025/07/27)
- **Image-Annotator-Lib API Compatibility**: Complete unified validation schema implementation
- **Capability-based Design**: TaskCapability system for Tags/Captions/Scores
- **Type Safety Enhancement**: Comprehensive Pydantic validation and strict typing

### Architecture State (2025/08/02)
- **Agent System**: Modern sub-agent delegation with MCP integration
- **Memory Management**: Serena-based context management active
- **Development Tools**: Optimized command/agent structure for efficient workflows
- **Local Packages**: genai-tag-db-tools + image-annotator-lib fully integrated
- **Core Application**: PySide6 MainWorkspaceWindow with Qt worker system stable

## Recent Test Quality & GUI Functionality Fixes (2025/07/23)
### Test Quality Methodology Improvement
- **Problem Solved**: Tests passing despite real usage bugs
- **Solution**: Reduced excessive mocking, real object integration tests
- **Impact**: Tests now catch integration issues effectively

### GUI Functionality Restoration  
- **Fixed**: DB registration, search functionality, thumbnail display
- **API Corrections**: Method names and import paths corrected
- **Validation**: All functionality confirmed working in Windows environment

## Development Environment Status
- **Package Manager**: uv with cross-platform environment support
- **GUI Framework**: PySide6 with Qt Designer integration  
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM and Alembic migrations
- **AI Integration**: Multi-provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Local models)
- **Code Quality**: Ruff formatting, mypy type checking, 75%+ test coverage

## Next Steps
### Immediate (Current Session)
1. Complete context migration to Serena memory management
2. Update CLAUDE.md to reflect MCP integration
3. Validate new agent/command workflows

### Short-term
1. Test new agent system with real development tasks
2. Document optimized workflows for development efficiency
3. Consider cleanup of legacy documentation files

This migration marks a significant modernization of LoRAIro's development infrastructure, moving from scattered file-based context management to unified MCP Serena integration.
