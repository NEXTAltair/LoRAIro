# Tasks Directory - Context Migration Completed

**Date**: 2025-08-24  
**Migration Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**

## Context Migration to MCP Serena Memory

This project has migrated from file-based task and context management to **MCP Serena memory-based management**.

### What Changed

**Previous System (Legacy)**:
- `active_context.md` - Current project context and focus
- `tasks_plan.md` - Current project tasks and planning

**New System (Current)**:
- **Serena Memory**: `mcp__serena__read_memory current-project-status`
- **Dynamic Context**: Maintained in `.serena/memories/` directory
- **Memory-First Development**: See CLAUDE.md for complete workflow

### Archived Files

Legacy context files have been archived to `archives/` subdirectory:
- `archives/active_context_20250812_archived.md`
- `archives/tasks_plan_20250812_archived.md`

**Note**: Content from these files was migrated to Serena memory as:
- `archived_active_context_20250812_docs_cleanup`
- `archived_tasks_plan_20250812_docs_cleanup`

### Current Directory Structure

- **`implementations/`** - Implementation task records (historical reference)
- **`investigations/`** - Investigation task records (historical reference)  
- **`plans/`** - Planning task records (historical reference)
- **`session_records/`** - Session completion records (historical reference)
- **`sessions/`** - Session phase records (historical reference)
- **`solutions/`** - Solution analysis records (historical reference)
- **`archives/`** - Archived legacy context files

### Using the New System

**For Current Project Status**:
```bash
mcp__serena__read_memory current-project-status
```

**For Active Development Context**:
```bash
mcp__serena__read_memory active-development-tasks
```

**For Historical Context**:
- Use archived files in `archives/` directory
- Use historical task files in subdirectories as needed
