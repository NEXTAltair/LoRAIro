- **Implementation Phase Preparation**: Ready to transition from PLAN MODE to ACT MODE with clear specifications

### Recently Completed Tasks  
1. **Requirements Clarification Session (2025/07/06)**: Systematically resolved 6 major ambiguous requirements through structured user dialogue
2. **Performance Requirements Finalized**: DB registration (1000 images/5 minutes), batch processing (100-image units)
3. **AI Integration Strategy Defined**: Model name direct specification, error skip handling, no cost controls
4. **Security Architecture Specified**: Plain-text config files, API key masking, policy violation tracking
5. **Architecture Decision Documented**: Hybrid controlled batch processing with clear performance targets
6. **Configuration Optimization (2025/07/07)**: Implemented DI + shared config pattern for immediate cross-instance updates

## Recent Major Changes

### Batch Processing Design Decision (2025-07-08)
- **Decision**: Adopted simple implementation approach for batch processing optimization
- **Approach**: Minimal changes to existing Worker + new dedicated batch function
- **Impact**: 1 new file (`simple_batch_processor.py`), 3 file modifications (progress.py, main_window.py)
- **Benefits**: Half-day implementation, maintains existing stability, meets 1000 images/5min performance target
- **Alternative Considered**: Complex worker hierarchy, hybrid approaches - rejected for complexity
- **Implementation**: Enhanced progress reporting (current/total/filename), improved cancellation, batch statistics

### Requirements Clarification and Documentation Update (2025-07-06)
- **Updated**: product_requirement_docs.md with clarified NFR1, FR1, FR5, NFR5, US1.2 requirements
- **Enhanced**: architecture.md with hybrid controlled batch processing architecture 
- **Specified**: Performance targets (DB registration: 1000 images/5 minutes, 100-image batches)
- **Defined**: AI integration strategy (model name specification, skip error handling)
- **Established**: Security policies (encrypted config files, API key masking, policy violation tracking)
- **Documented**: All decisions with 2025/07/06 clarification timestamps

### Development Rules Implementation
- **Created**: .cursor/rules/ directory with comprehensive development guidelines
  - `rules.mdc`: Core development principles and workflow

## Development Workflow

### Current Development Commands
```bash
# Environment setup
uv sync --dev

# Application execution
lorairo
python -m lorairo.main

# Testing
pytest
pytest -m unit
pytest -m integration
pytest -m gui

# Code quality
ruff check
ruff format
mypy src/

# Database operations
alembic upgrade head
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"
```

### Configuration Management
- **Main Config**: `config/lorairo.toml` - Application settings and AI provider configuration
- **Environment Variables**: API keys and development flags
- **Local Package Config**: Managed through uv.sources in pyproject.toml

## Known Issues and Considerations

### Resolved Issues
- **Context Structure**: Successfully migrated to integrated .cursor/rules/ and structured docs/tasks approach
- **Development Rules**: Established comprehensive guidelines for AI-assisted development
- **Documentation Consistency**: Achieved alignment between main project and submodule documentation patterns

### Current Challenges
- **Documentation Consistency**: Maintain consistency across all documentation files
- **Testing Coverage**: Ensure all components maintain >75% test coverage
- **Configuration Validation**: Implement comprehensive configuration validation and error handling

### Future Considerations
- **Performance Optimization**: Monitor and optimize for large dataset processing
- **Plugin Architecture**: Consider extensible architecture for custom AI providers
- **Cloud Integration**: Potential cloud storage and processing capabilities

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Current Session)
1. **Implement Simple Batch Processing**: Create `simple_batch_processor.py` and modify Worker components
2. **Enhanced Progress Reporting**: Add batch-specific progress signals (current/total/filename)
3. **Main Window Integration**: Update `dataset_dir_changed()` to use new batch processing
4. **Testing and Validation**: Verify 1000 images/5min performance target

### Short-term Goals (Next Few Sessions)
1. **Enhanced Testing**: Expand test coverage and add integration tests for local packages

## Historical Context

### Relevant Historical Information from Project Development

**Project Foundation (2025-04-14 to 2025-04-17)**
- AI annotation functionality delegated to `image-annotator-lib` for separation of concerns
- Database migration from SQLite to SQLAlchemy ORM completed with Alembic migrations
- Project structure reorganized to src/lorairo layout following Python standards
- Configuration management refactored from ConfigManager singleton to ConfigurationService with dependency injection
- GUI components refactored to separate business logic from presentation layer
- Documentation structure aligned with 3-tier architecture (interfaces, application, core)

**Key Architectural Decisions**
- Adopted uv as package manager for speed and usability
- Implemented service layer pattern with dependency injection
- Separated AI annotation concerns to external library (`image-annotator-lib`)
- Established SQLAlchemy-based database layer with proper migrations
- Implemented ConfigurationService to replace problematic singleton pattern

**Development Patterns Established**
- Code quality: PEP 8 compliance, modern type hints, pathlib usage
- Testing: pytest with BDD approach using pytest-bdd
- Documentation: Google-style docstrings, comprehensive module documentation
- Error handling: Specific exception catching with clear error messages
- Architecture: Single responsibility principle, proper encapsulation
