Tag search results are displayed in a master/detail layout. The main table (master view) on the left shows a summary of tag information, including `tag`, `type_id`, the default `ja` translation, `usage_count`, and `type_name`. The detail panel on the right displays the default `ja` translation and any other available translations for the selected language from the `translations` dictionary.
