The `core_api.search_tags` function does not provide a direct way to list all unknown tags. An empty keyword search only returns all tags when the `partial` parameter is set to `True`. This makes it difficult to discover tags that are not already known. There is no dedicated public API endpoint for listing all tags without a search query.
