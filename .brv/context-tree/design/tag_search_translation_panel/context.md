The tag search translation panel, part of the `TagSearchWidget`, now features an inline language dropdown next to the 'Translation' label. This dropdown allows for dynamic updating of the translation list based on the selected language, independent of the primary search language filter. It is populated from the available tag languages found in the database and defaults to 'ja'. This provides a more intuitive and flexible way for users to view tag translations.
