Search returns per-tag format_statuses (format->alias/deprecated/usage_count/type_name) and translations; display filters by selected result format without re-query; format key normalized (strip/lower) and rows lacking status are excluded. format_statuses built with preferred tag IDs to avoid missing data under resolve_preferred.
