Phase1 environment setup (2025-10-22) proved the workflow: run uv lock --upgrade in repo + each local package, then uv sync --dev, verify editable installs via uv pip list, and confirm tooling with uv run pytest --collect-only, uv run ruff format --check, uv run ruff check, and make mypy. Reuse these commands whenever rebuilding the dev env instead of ad-hoc steps.
