Documents for image-annotator-lib are no longer stored in docs/: Phase 1.5 migrated implementation histories to Serena memories and design/requirements to Cipher, then deleted 12 legacy files plus .roo/.cursor configs. Treat .serena/memories as the short-term source of truth and Cipher as long-term; do not recreate doc copies in the repo.
